# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is recommended that you run the stable version as this is more tested and used by most. The dev branch is bleed-edge commits that are not well tested and aren't meant to be used in production environments

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| dev     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I'd recommend making an Issue for reporting a bug. If you would like privately submit the bug you can email me at contact@christitus.com
