# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is recommended that you run the stable branch as this is more tested and used by most. The dev branch is bleeding-edge commits that are not well tested and aren't meant to be used in production environments.<br>
Tags lower than the [latest stable](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/releases/latest) are **not** supported.

| Branch  | Supported              |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Stable  | :white_check_mark: YES |
| Dev     | :x:                 NO |
