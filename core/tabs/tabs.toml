# The postinstall orchestrator script (`postinstall.sh`) is placed at the root of tabs directory.
# It is not part of a tab_data.toml. If you want it exposed inside the TUI as a command,
# consider wrapping it into a minimal tab (e.g., create a `postinstall/tab_data.toml`).
# For now we leave this comment as documentation of its purpose.
