## Usage

Open your terminal and paste this command
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/releases/latest/download/start.sh | sh
```

## Developing
Clone the repo and in the `startdev.sh` change `ISLOCAL=false` to `ISLOCAL=true`. This will make the script run cargo run instead of getting the binary from github.
