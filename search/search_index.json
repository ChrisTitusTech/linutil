If you use [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) or any other [AUR Helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), it's even simpler:  <pre><code>paru -S linutil\n</code></pre>  Replace `paru` with your preferred helper and `linutil` with your preferred package.   Cargo  LinUtil can be installed via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) with:  <pre><code>cargo install linutil\n</code></pre>  Note that crates installed using `cargo install` require manual updating with `cargo install --force` (update functionality is [included in LinUtil](https://christitustech.github.io/linutil/userguide/#applications-setup))   <p>After you've ran the command, you should see a GUI on your screen; It will look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Info</p> <p>LinUtil is updated weekly as of the time of writing.
